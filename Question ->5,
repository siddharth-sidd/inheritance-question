/*Question -> Write a C++ program to calculate the percentage of a student using multi-levelinheritance. Accept the marks of three
 subjects in base class. A class will be derived from the above mentioned class which includes a function to find
  the total marks obtained and another class derived from this class which calculates and displays the percentage of students.*/
